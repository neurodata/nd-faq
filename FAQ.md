**Q:** How is life as a graduate student at JHU (or life at Baltimore in general)?

**A:** *@BPedigo* I love it! I have been happy with my work/life balance most of the time, and I have enjoyed
getting to explore the city. Lots of good food and drink here, IMO. I have also found many close friends 
within the program and think we have a good community here in the PhD program.

**Q:** What are some of the current projects the team is working on and what must-know techniques are being used?

**A:** See current projects tab.

**Q:** What should I expect as a first year student in regards to class/research balance?

**A:** *@BPedigo* I wish I knew quantitatively how much I spent on classes vs. research last year, but if I had to guess I'd 
say 50/50 (+/- 10%). Both are definitely important, and I think there are a lot of great classes here that have
helped me grow a lot and have been helpful for research. Though, I'm definitey here to do research!

**Q:** What is the process for adopting a project in the lab?

**A:** *@BPedigo* I'm sure it varies a lot, Jovo didn't tell me what to work on though, and I had to try a few different
things to figure out what I wanted to do. For me, the first week or two I was in the lab I asked Jovo to 
go through all of his [grants](https://neurodata.io/about/funding/) with me. I found that helpful to get a big 
picture of what was going on, but it definitely didn't cover all of the options available to me. One project from the grants
sounded interesting to me and I ended up meeting with that experimental lab, and I worked on that project off and on 
for a few months. I also met another experimentalist and I played with some analysis of his data that never really
went anywhere, partially because I was working on the other project and taking classes. I also started a project 
called [GraSPy](https://graspy.neurodata.io/) while taking Jovo's class, which definitely was the most succesful out of those.
Finally in April, I met with some ANOTHER group of experimentalists at a conference whom we had worked with previously, 
and I was really excited about their new data. I ended up deciding that was the project I wanted to focus on and 
I've been working on that ever since, and I'm using GraSPy to do a lot of the analysis, which is cool!
