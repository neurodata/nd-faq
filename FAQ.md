# Q & A

### Respondents:
*@BPedigo* - 2nd-year BME PhD Student in NeuroData lab
*@hhelm* - Assistant Research Engineer (JHU undergrad / masters)

**Q:** How is life as a graduate student at JHU (or life at Baltimore in general)?

**A:** *@BPedigo* I love it! I have been happy with my work/life balance most of the time, and I have enjoyed
getting to explore the city. Lots of good food and drink here, IMO. I have also found many close friends 
within the program and think we have a good community here in the PhD program.

**Q:** What are some of the current projects the team is working on and what must-know techniques are being used?

**A:** See current projects tab.

**Q:** What should I expect as a first year student in regards to class/research balance?

**A:** *@BPedigo* I wish I knew quantitatively how much I spent on classes vs. research last year, but if I had to guess I'd 
say 50/50 (+/- 10%). Both are definitely important, and I think there are a lot of great classes here that have
helped me grow a lot and have been helpful for research. Though, I'm definitey here to do research!

**Q:** What is the process for adopting a project in the lab?

**A:** *@BPedigo* I'm sure it varies a lot, Jovo didn't tell me what to work on though, and I had to try a few different
things to figure out what I wanted to do. For me, the first week or two I was in the lab I asked Jovo to 
go through all of his [grants](https://neurodata.io/about/funding/) with me. I found that helpful to get a big 
picture of what was going on, but it definitely didn't cover all of the options available to me. One project from the grants
sounded interesting to me and I ended up meeting with that experimental lab, and I worked on that project off and on 
for a few months. I also met another experimentalist and I played with some analysis of his data that never really
went anywhere, partially because I was working on the other project and taking classes. I also started a project 
called [GraSPy](https://graspy.neurodata.io/) while taking Jovo's class, which definitely was the most succesful out of those.
Finally in April, I met with some ANOTHER group of experimentalists at a conference whom we had worked with previously, 
and I was really excited about their new data. I ended up deciding that was the project I wanted to focus on and 
I've been working on that ever since, and I'm using GraSPy to do a lot of the analysis, which is cool! 

**A:** *@hhelm* I came into the lab having completed a master's thesis under Carey Priebe (who works closely with the methods / statistical side of our lab). I planned on working on extensions of that research. This, however, was not obviously useful to our lab or for achieving our goals and so Jovo and I found a set projects for me that are both interesting and useful. In my experience, Jovo is able and willing to help you find meaningful (to you and the community) projects that are both in your area of expertise and well aligned with the lab's interests.
